 .SYNOPSIS

  Update the Git hooks when required.

 .DESCRIPTION

  A few standard Git hooks are established to manage the "commit count"
  which is used to identify the product version.

  The actual code to execute is in build\git-hook.sh. This script is executed
  on Windows using the so-called "Git Bash" (in practice, a trimmed version
  of Msys). The hook name is passed as parameter.

  The template for a hook script is:

    #!/bin/bash
    exec $GIT_DIR/../build/git-hook.sh <hook-name>

 .PARAMETER NoPause

  Do not wait for the user to press <enter> at end of execution. By default,
  execute a "pause" instruction at the end of execution, which is useful
  when the script was run from Windows Explorer.
#>
param([switch]$NoPause = $false)

# List of Git hooks to set.
$GitLooksList = @("pre-commit", "post-merge")

# Git hooks are in .git/hooks
$GitHooksDir = (Join-Path (Join-Path (Split-Path -Parent $PSScriptRoot) .git) hooks)

# Check each hook for the line to execute.
$GitLooksList | ForEach-Object {
    $name = $_
    $file = (Join-Path $GitHooksDir $name)
    $line = "exec `$(dirname `$0)/../../build/git-hook.sh $name"
    $fileOK = (Test-Path $file)
    if (-not $fileOK -or -not (Select-String -Quiet -Path $file -SimpleMatch $line)) {
        Write-Output "  [GIT] updating $name hook"
        # We use IO.File methods to enforce LF as end of line.
        if (-not $fileOK) {
            [IO.File]::WriteAllText($file, "#!/bin/bash`n")
        }
        [IO.File]::AppendAllText($file, "$line`n")
    }
}

# Exit script.
if (-not $NoPause) {
    pause
}
