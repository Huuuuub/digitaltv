<#
 .SYNOPSIS

  Clean up the project directory tree, back to a clean state of source files.

 .DESCRIPTION

  Delete generated binary and documentation files.
  
 .PARAMETER NoPause

  Do not wait for the user to press <enter> at end of execution. By default,
  execute a "pause" instruction at the end of execution, which is useful
  when the script was run from Windows Explorer.

 .PARAMETER Silent

  Do not report deleted files.

 .PARAMETER Deep

  Delete absolutely all non-source files, including the git repository.
  This is typically done on a COPY of the project directory tree to create
  an archive of the source code.

# Note that we cannot pipe Get-ChildItem directly into Remove-Item since Get-ChildItem -Recurse
# return directories first, followed by their content. So, we first get the list of files and
# directories to remove and then we delete them, if not yet deleted by a previous recursion.
