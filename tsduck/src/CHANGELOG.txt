TSDUCK CHANGE LOG AND RELEASE NOTES

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.15-1007

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tsswitch", a TS input switcher with remote control.
  * Added command "tsgenecm", generate one ECM using any DVB SimulCrypt ECMG.
  * Added plugin "limit" to limit the global TS bitrate.
  * Added plugin "duplicate" to duplicate one or more PID's.
  * Added plugins "encap" and "decap" to encapsulate and decapsulate PID's
    into one single tunnel PID.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The plugin "fork" can now be used as input and output plugin as well. When
    used as an input plugin (new), it reads packets from the command output.
  * Added option --ignore-errors to "tsbitrate" and plugin "pcrbitrate".
  * Added option --receive-timeout to "tstabdump" and plugins "dektec" (input),
    "ip" (input), "mpeinject".
  * Added options --udp-size, --min-udp-size, --max-udp-size, --net-size,
    --min-net-size, --max-net-size to plugin "mpe".
  * Added option --network-id to plugin "nitscan".
  * Added option --strict-xml to "tstabcomp", "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added option --max-packets to "tsdump".
  * The command "tsdump" can now accept multiple input files.
  * Added demodulator support in the input plugin "dektec" (e.g. DTA-2137).
  * Added options --audio-pid and --eit to plugin "zap".
  * Added option --sei-type to plugin "pes".
  * Added option --event-id to plugin "rmsplice".
  * Added the per-user configuration file $HOME/.tsduck to specify default or
    alternate options to various commands.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In XML documents which were generated by TSDuck, some characters were not
    properly escaped.
  * In "tsp", in case of output error, when a plugin was slowing down the
    playout speed (such as "regulate"), the command was slow to terminate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.14-894

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "sections".
  * Optional rebuild without teletext support (without plugin "teletext").

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --remove-stream-type to plugin "pmt".
  * Added options --network-name, --network-id and --nit-other to plugin "nit".
  * Added option --provider to plugin "svrename".
  * Added options --include-next and --exclude-current to commands "tstables"
    and "tspsi" and to plugins "tables" and "psi".
  * Added options --rewrite-binary and --rewrite-xml to command "tstables" and
    plugin "tables".
  * Added keywork "system" to option --start in plugin "timeref".
  * Added option --transparent to plugin "merge".
  * Added options --other, --ts-id, --original-network-id to plugin "sdt".
  * Added options --create, --create-after, --bitrate, --inter-packet to
    plugins "pat", "pmt", "bat", "sdt", "nit".
  * Added option --wide-display to command "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
  * Added option --min-interval to command "tsstuff".
  * Added option --scte35 to plugin "pcrextract".
  * In plugin "inject", when all input files have specific repetition rates,
    it is no longer required to provide a bitrate for the PID. It is computed
    from the size and repetition rate of all sections.
  * Some performance improvement by removing processing which are used in debug
    or verbose mode only (options --debug and --verbose).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In plugin "merge", merging CAT's from two streams was incorrect
    (incorrect PID conflict detection and endless code loop).
  * On Windows, "tslsdvb" and "tshides" could crash when using a HiDes
    UT-100A (combined received / modulator).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.13-833

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added input plugin "http" to receive a transport stream using a URL.
  * Added support for HiDes UT-100C modulator device using utility "tshides"
    and output plugin "hides". Be sure to install the right device drivers
    from https://tsduck.io/download/hides/

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * With plugins "svremove", "svrename" and "tsrename", the removal or renaming
    now also apply to EIT's. The new option --ignore-eit can be used to prevent
    this.
  * The plugin "regulate" can now also use the PCR from the TS to regulate the
    transmission. Previously, the regulation was done on bitrate only. Added
    options are --pcr-synchronous, --pid-pcr and --wait-min.
  * The input plugin "ip" and the plugin "mpeinject" now accept the syntax
    'source-ip@multicast-ip:port' for source-specific multicast (SSM). As a
    side effect, the command "tstabdump" also accepts this syntax when
    receiving PSI/SI tables.
  * Added option --tos to output plugin "ip".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Bug fix: Option --cleanup-private-descriptors in plugins "bat", "cat",
    "nit", "pmt" and "sdt" failed to cleanup contiguous private descriptors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.12-778

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "merge" which merges two transport streams.
  * On Windows, portable packages are now built for users without admin
    privilege.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --realtime to "tsp". This option selects appropriate default
    options when operating on real-time streamings. The "default defaults"
    remain appropriate for offline processing, such as working on transport
    streams files. This option is also automatically set by some plugins which
    are designed for real-time streaming ("dvb", "ip", dektec", "play",
    "regulate", "mpeinject").
  * The option --reuse-port is now on by default on all commands and plugins
    which use it. A new option --no-reuse-port has been added everywhere to
    disable the option explicitly (although probably never used).
  * Added options --log-protocol and --log-data to "tsecmg", "tsemmg" and
    plugins "scrambler", "datainject".
  * Added options --udp and --unregulated to plugin "datainject".
  * Many more descriptors are supported. See the user's guide.
  * In "tsemmg", sending UDP data to a broadcast address was not allowed. Now
    it is possible to send data to a local broadcast address. Using routed
    broadcast remains not possible (because this is usually not a good thing
    to route broadcast).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * If an XML representation of a splice information table contained a
    splice_insert command, the <break_duration> structure was rejected when the
    event was marked as immediate.
  * In "tsemmg", the TCP disconnection of the MUX was not detected in a timely
    fashion when data was injected using UDP.
  * In "tsecmg", the option --max-comp-time was ignored.
  * Regression fix: In plugin "datainject", the section mode was no longer
    handled correctly since version 3.10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.11-715

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added utility "tsemmg", an EMMG simulator for MUX integration testing.
  * Added plugin "spliceinject" to inject SCTE 35 splice information in real
    time.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --sync-layout, --dump-datagram, --dump-udp, --dump-max and
    --skip to plugin "mpe".
  * Added option --buffer-size in plugin "datainject". The plugin is now able
    to receive data using UDP, as defined in the DVB SimulCrypt protocol.
  * SCTE 35 splice information tables can now be created from XML format.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", when options --xml and --max-tables
    were both specified, the XML structure was not properly closed.
  * Application Information Tables (AIT) were not correctly serialized.
  * In rare cases, time conversions could produce incorrect results when the
    time value was in the middle of the "non-existing hour", during the
    spring switch of daylight saving time. In practice, the problem occured on
    Linux when handling the "next change time" of a TOT and the system local
    time was UTC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.10-672

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added utility "tsecmg", a DVB SimulCrypt-compliant ECMG stub to test system
    integration. The plugin "descrambler" has been enhanced to decode the
    'fake' ECM's which are generated by "tsecmg".

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * The utility "tstabdump" can now dump sections and files which are sent over
    UDP/IP by "tstables" or the plugin "tables". Command line options were
    added to specify UDP parameters (same UDP reception options as input plugin
    "ip").
  * Added options --fix and --pid to plugin "continuity".
  * Added option --after-packets to plugin "filter".
  * Added options --default-interface to input plugin "ip" and plugin
    "mpeinject".
  * Added options --inter-time, --max-insert-count, --min-pts, --max-pts and
    --pts-pid to plugin "mux".
  * Added option --milli-seconds to plugin "history".
  * Input plugin "file" can now read more than one file. Input files are
    concatenated as input stream.
  * Added option --fifo-size to output plugin "dektec".
  * Added option --atis-idsa to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler" (perform
    ATIS-IDSA scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2).
  * Added option --integer to tsversion (useful to check a version in a script).

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Incorrect behaviour on Linux and macOS when receiving multicast with
    plugins "ip" and "mpeinject" and a --local-interface was specified.
  * The command "tsanalyze" and a few plugins could crash when a video PID
    contained corrupted AVC/H.264 video (or incorrect video data which looked
    like H.264).
  * Plugin "analyze" with option --interval incorrectly used the TS clock to
    produce the analysis files instead of the wall clock time.
  * Plugin "history": Detection of scrambling transitions: Now ignore packets
    without payload or with short payloads (less than 8 bytes). These packets
    are normally left clear in a scrambled PID. Considering them as clear
    packets used to report spurious scrambled-to-clear transitions, immediately
    followed by clear-to-scrambled transistions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.9-619

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Precompiled binaries are now provided for Raspbian on Raspberry Pi.
  * Added plugins "mpe" and "mpeinject" to respectively extract and inject MPE
    (Multi-Protocol Encapsulation) datagrams to/from UDP/IP. A complete example
    is provided in the user's guide.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --add-start-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing to "tsp".
  * Added options --sei-avc and --uuid-sei to plugin "pes".
  * Added options --add-programinfo-id, --set-stream-identifier, --set-cue-type
    and --set-data-broadcast-id to plugin "pmt".
  * Added option --identify to plugin "t2mi".
  * Added options --all-once, --pack-all-sections and --pack-and-flush to
    "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added option --default-charset to "tsanalyze" and plugin "analyze".
  * Added signalization for data broadcast and MPE.
  * Improved display of Dektec devices capabilities.
  * In all TSDuck commands, parameters can be read from a file using the syntax
    "@filename" anywhere in the command line. See the user's guide for details.
  * Added possibility to specify a GitHub authentication token in "tsversion"
    to avoid "API rate limit exceeded" errors.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", when all sections were collected (option
    --all), the sections were not properly saved in binary section files
    (option --binary).
  * On Windows, the command "tsversion --upgrade" failed because tsversion.exe
    and tsduck.dll were locked by upgrade command.
  * On Linux: With DVB-T tuners which do not support "auto bandwidth"
    (PCTV 492e for instance), "tscan" failed to scan the UHF band.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.8-534

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --source and --first-source to input plugin "ip".
  * Added option --periodic-bitrate to plugin "bitrate_monitor".
  * Added options --pid, --csv and --log to plugin "pcrextract".
  * Added XML support for more DVB and EACEM descriptors.
  * When the output plugin "play" uses VLC, the player exits automatically at
    the end of the video playout.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * On macOS, the output plugin "play" now correctly detects VLC in its
    original installation path.
  * In the compilation of XML tables, when DVB strings were encoded with
    a character set different from ISO-6937 (the default character set), the
    table code was not correctly inserted at the beginning of the string.
  * In plugin "bitrate_monitor". The message was incorrect when the bitrate
    is greater then the limit (the message was ok in other cases).
  * In plugin "rmsplice", with option --adjust time, the time stamps were
    not correctly adjusted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.7-512

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added plugin "teletext" to extract Teletext subtitles in SRT format.
  * Added plugin "rmsplice" to remove ads insertions when signaled using
    SCTE 35 splice information.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --add-ca-descriptor to plugin "pmt".
  * More details are displayed in SCTE 35 splice information.
  * The command "tsp --list" is now paged, like option --help.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", with XML output, option --time-stamp
    was ineffective and option --packet-index was always on.
  * In plugin "pcrextract", options --pts and --dts were reversed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.6-491

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added the utility "tsversion" to manage TSDuck versions, detect new
    versions, upgrade, etc.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added options --synchronous-log and --log-message-count to "tsp". They
    affect the way log messages are dropped or displayed in case a vast amount
    of log messages are produced in a short period of time.
  * Added option --plp to "tsscan" and plugin "dvb". Used to select the DVB-T2
    PLP. This option is unsupported on Windows.
  * Added options --output-file, --append and --keep to plugin "t2mi".
  * Added HEVC signalization.
  * Added SCTE 35 signalization (splice information for ads insertion).
  * The help text of all TSDuck applications (using option --help) is now paged
    through "less" or any any other pager application.

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In input plugin "ip", when multiple multicast streams are sent to the same
    UDP port (although with different addresses), make sure we receive only the
    requested stream. Previously, in some system configurations, the input
    plugin "ip" could receive packets from distinct multicast streams.
  * Various fixes about UDP on macOS: multicast reception, --reuse-port option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.5-414

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --xml-output to "tstables" and plugin "tables". Tables can be
    saved directly in XML format. It is no longer necessary to save in binary
    and then use the decompiler to rebuild XML files.
  * With "tstables" and plugin "tables", it is possible to specify several
    formats at the same time. For instance, it is possible to save tables in
    text, XML and binary format at the same time.
  * With "tspacketize" and plugin "inject", it is now possible to load tables
    in XML format. The options --binary and --xml have been added to specify
    the file type if its name is neither .bin nor .xml. It is no longer
    necessary to use the compiler to rebuild binary section files.
  * Added option --byte to "tsftrunc".
  * The options --verbose and --debug have been generalized to all commands.
  * For programmers, the TSDuck library API was extensively modified. Usage
    of 8-bit strings (char* and std::string) has been removed and replaced by
    Java-like Unicode strings (ts::UString). Many interface have been updated.
    The utilities in tsStringUtils have been removed. Equivalent services exist
    in class ts::UString. All of this break the backward compatibility of user
    code. This is unfortunate but TSDuck code is now more robust and faster to
    maintain.
  * The "revision" number is no longer a "build date" but a "commit count".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.4-20171110

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added "t2mi" plugin to extract encapsulated TS packets from T2-MI streams
    (DVB-T2 Modulator Interface).

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * TSDuck now fully handles DVB character sets in signalization. All textual
    display ("tsanalyze", "tstables", etc.) are produced in UTF-8 format, with
    characters properly translated from DVB character encoding. The table
    compiler, "tstabcomp", properly translates from UTF-8 XML files to DVB
    character encoding and vice versa.
  * Added options --default-charset and --europe to "tspsi", "tstables",
    "tstabdump", "tstabcomp", plugins "psi" and "tables".
  * T2-MI PID's and PLP's are now included in the report from "tsanalyze" and
    plugin "analyze".
  * Added --test option to "tslsdvb" on Windows.
  * Improved robustness of DVB tuner detection on Windows. It solves some
    issues with 32-bit tuner filters on 64-bit systems. But older systems,
    before Windows 7 (XP, Vista, etc.), may no longer work. No further support
    will be provided for pre-7 Windows systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.3-20170930

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Removed command "tsgentab" and associated plugins. This command is now
    obsolete and has been superseded by the more general "tstabcomp", the
    PSI/SI table compiler.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --interval to plugin "count".
  * Added option --default-pds to "tspsi", "tstables", "tstabdump", plugins
    "psi" and "tables".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * Fixed timer issues on Linux, typically seen in plugin "regulate".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.3-20170915

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added command "tstabcomp", the PSI/SI table compiler from/to XML files.
    The command tsgentab is now deprecated and will be removed in some
    future version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.2-20170911

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --pid to plugin descrambler.
  * Improved robustness of option --poll-file in plugin "inject". Mitigate
    possible race conditions when the plugin tries to open a section file
    while it is created/copied by the user. Now retry later.
  * Improved robustness of DVB tuner reception on Windows. Explicitly
    resynchronizes on valid packets when the driver misses data.
  * Adjusted output of "tslsdvb" on Windows to better identify tuner names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.2-20170528

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --poll-file to plugin "inject".

[BUG] Bug fixes:

  * In "tstables" and plugin "tables", the option --max-tables was not accurate
    when several small tables (eg. EMM's) were packed in the same TS packet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.2-20170525

[NEW] New commands and plugins:

  * Added the development environment in the Windows Installer. This is used to
    develop third-party applications using the TSDuck library. On Ubuntu, added
    the tsduck-dev package. On RPM-based distros, the tsduck-devel package
    already existed.

[IMP] Improvements on existing commands and plugins:

  * Added option --no-duplicate to "tstables" and plugin "tables".
  * Added TSPLUGINS_PATH environment variable to use "tsp" plugins outside the
    directory of the TSDuck executables.
