    //! This class starts an internal thread which periodically wakes up
    //! and reports the usage of system resources by the current process
    //! (virtual memory usage, CPU load). In addition to precise usage
    //! values, it also displays an analysis of the virtual memory usage
    //! (such as stable or leaking).
    //!
    //! The reporting interval is changing over time, very fast at the
    //! start of the application, then slower and slower:
    //!
    //! - Up to start + 2 mn, log every 10 seconds
    //! - Up to start + 10 mn, log every minute
    //! - Up to start + 20 mn, log every 2 minutes
    //! - Up to start + 1 hour, log every 5 minutes
    //! - After start + 1 hour, log every 30 minutes
