    //! This class is useful only when using the TSDuck static library.
    //! It is useless, although harmless, when using the TSDuck DLL or shared library.
    //!
    //! Within the TSDuck library, DVB classes like tables, descriptors or
    //! character sets register themselves in a factory system when their
    //! object module is initialized. All these modules are in the TSDuck
    //! library. When using the TSDuck DLL (Windows) or shared library (UNIX),
    //! all these DVB object modules are automatically included and registered.
    //!
    //! However, when using the TSDuck static library, no direct reference
    //! exist to these modules and they are not included in the final executable.
    //! As a consequence, most DVB tables, descriptors or character sets are
    //! not recognized when present in transport streams.
    //!
    //! This file creates dummy references to all known DVB classes which
    //! register themselves without other explicit reference. By referencing
    //! this file from the application, all DVB classes are forced into the
    //! final executable. Again, this is required only when linking against
    //! the TSDuck static library.
    //!
    //! This class does nothing. But creating an instance of it automatically
    //! pulls references to all self-registered DVB classes:
    //!
    class TSDUCKDLL StaticReferencesDVB
    {
    public:
        //!
        //! Default constructor.
        //!
        StaticReferencesDVB();
    private:
        std::vector<const void*> _refs;
    };
}
