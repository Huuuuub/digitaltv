        //!  Data model
        //!  ----------
        //!  There is a global buffer for TS packets. The input thread writes incoming
        //!  packets here. All packet processors update them and the output thread
        //!  picks them for the same place.
        //!
        //!  The buffer is an array of ts::TSPacket. It is managed in a circular way.
        //!  It is divided into logical areas, one per processor (including input
        //!  and output). These logical areas are sliding windows which move when
        //!  packets are processed.
        //!
        //!  Each sliding window is defined by the index of its first packet
        //!  (_pkt_first) and its size in packets (_pkt_cnt).
        //!
        //!  @anchor PacketBufferDiagram
        //!  Flat (non-circular) view of the buffer:
        //!
        //!  @code
        //!        output->_pkt_first            proc_1->_pkt_first

        //!  @endcode
        //!
        //!  When a thread terminates the processing of a bunch of packets, it moves
        //!  up its first index and, consequently, decreases the sizes of its area
        //!  and accordingly increases the size of the area of the next processor.
        //!
        //!  The modification of the starting index and size of any area must be
        //!  performed under the protection of the global mutex. There is one global
        //!  mutex for simplicity. The resulting bottleneck is not so important since
        //!  updating a few pointers is fast.
        //!
        //!  When the sliding window of a processor is empty, the processor thread
        //!  sleeps on its "_to_do" condition variable. Consequently, when a thread
        //!  passes packets to the next processor (ie. increases the size of the sliding
        //!  window of the next processor), it must notify the _to_do condition variable
        //!  of the next thread.
        //!
        //!  When a packet processor decides to drop a packet, the synchronization
        //!  byte (first byte of the packet, normally 0x47) is reset to zero. When
        //!  a packet processor or the output processor encounters a packet starting
        //!  with a zero byte, it ignores it.
        //!
        //!  All PluginExecutors are chained in a ring. The first one is input and
        //!  the last one is output. The output points back to the input so that the
        //!  output processor can easily pass free packets to be reused by the input
        //!  processor.
        //!
        //!  The "_input_end" indicates that there is no more packet to process
        //!  after those in the processor's area. This condition is signaled by
        //!  the previous processor in the chain. All processors, except the output
        //!  processor, may signal this condition to their successor.
        //!
        //!  The "_aborted" indicates that the current processor has encountered an
        //!  error and has ceased to accept packets. This condition is checked by
        //!  the previous processor in the chain (which, in turn, will declare itself
        //!  as aborted). All processors, except the input processor may signal this
        //!  condition. In case of error, all processors should also declare an
        //!  "_input_end" to their successor.
