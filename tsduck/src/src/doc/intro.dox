/** @mainpage TSDuck MPEG Transport Stream Library for C++

TSDuck is a toolkit which manipulates MPEG Transport Streams (TS).
<br>

As a product, TSDuck provides many different command-line tools and plugins.
Internally, the architecture of TSDuck is made of a large shareable
library (@c tsduck.dll on Windows, @c tsduck.so on Linux and macOS).
Most of the valuable processing is performed by the various C++ classes
from the TSDuck library. All command-line tools and plugins are usually
small wrappers around this library.

The TSDuck library offers generic C++ classes for operating systems features
as well as specialized classes for MPEG/DVB transport streams. This library
can be used as a general-purpose C++ library for third-party applications,
outside the TSDuck tools and plugins.

This set of documentation is a reference for the TSDuck library. It can be
used either by TSDuck maintainers and developers of third-party applications.
