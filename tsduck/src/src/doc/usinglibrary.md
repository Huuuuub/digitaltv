# Using the TSDuck library   {#usinglibrary}
[TOC]

# Pre-requisites {#libreq}

To be able to build applications or `tsp` plugins with the TSDuck library,
you must install the TSDuck development environment first.

- On Windows systems, you must select the optional "Development" component
  during the installation.
- On Fedora, Red Hat and CentOS, you must install the package `tsduck-devel`.
- On Ubuntu systems, you must install the package `tsduck-dev`.

# Building applications on Linux  {#liblinux}

The TSDuck header files are located in `/usr/include/tsduck`.
In the same directory, a partial makefile named `tsduck.mk` defines
all options and requirements to use the TSDuck library.

The following sample makefile illustrates the creation of a simple
application named `myexec` using one single source file `myexec.cpp`.
~~~~
include /usr/include/tsduck/tsduck.mk
default: myexec
~~~~
This is as simple as that.

Just run "make" to build the application.
~~~~
$ make
~~~~

By default, the application is built against the TSDuck dynamic
library in `/usr/bin`. Define the make symbol `TS_STATIC` to link against
the TSDuck static library:
~~~~
$ make TS_STATIC=true
~~~~

# Building applications on Windows  {#libwindows}

The "Development" option of the TSDuck installer provides the build
environment for Visual Studio 2017, in debug and release mode, for
32-bit and 64-bit platforms.

The environment variable `TSDUCK` is defined to the root of the
TSDuck installation tree. A Visual Studio property file named
`tsduck.props` is installed here. It provides all definitions
and options to use the TSDuck library.

Create the solution and projects for your application. Then, manually
edit the project file, named for instance `app.vcxproj`, and insert
the following line just before the final `</Project>` closing tag:
~~~~
<Import Project="$(TSDUCK)\tsduck.props" />
~~~~

Then build your project normally.
